\chapter*{Abstract} 
This project aims to robustly process images of motorcycle's connecting rods, 
taken under different settings, distinguish between different types of rods, 
and compute several metrics (length, width, barycenter, width at barycenter, 
position(s) of the hole(s) and corresponding diameter(s)).
In particular, variations of lighting conditions, noise and distractors' presence, 
and the possibility of partial overlapping between objects are possible scenarios.
By exploiting standard Computer vision Algorithms, and simple ideas from Machine Learning, 
a completely automated pipeline, capable of dealing with all aforementioned obstacles, is implemented.
